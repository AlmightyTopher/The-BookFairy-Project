    "Hold on darlin', I'm rustlin' up your book faster than gossip at a church picnic.",
    "Lawd, you sure do keep me busy. Let me sprinkle some fairy dust and see what pops up.",
    "Mercy, child, give me a second while I work my charms."
  ],
  "presenting": [
    "Here's the gem I conjured up, sugar. Don't say I never do nothin' for you.",

**🔧 MAM Gateway Detailed Implementation Plan**

#### 1) Plan and Sessions
- ❌ Create two separate MAM sessions in Preferences > Security:
  - One for torrent client (dynamic seedbox)
  - One for new MAM gateway search service
- ❌ Configure VPN/IP considerations:
  - Torrent client session: ASN-locked with dynamic seedbox enabled
  - Gateway session: IP-locked (stable) or ASN-locked (rotating IPs)
- ❌ Add rate-limit awareness to avoid "too many requests"
- ❌ Implement throttle bulk searches

#### 2) Repo Structure, Files, and Config
- ❌ Create `services/mam-gateway` directory with Node TypeScript layout
- ❌ Add project metadata files, scripts, and build outputs to `dist`
- ❌ Create `config/mam.env` with variables:
  - MAM session, base URL, rate limit, concurrency
  - Wedge policy, optional mamapi polling
- ❌ Update `.gitignore` for secrets and build artifacts

#### 3) Compose Wiring
- ❌ Add `mam-gateway` container service to compose stack
- ❌ Optional `mamapi` service for automated session refresh
- ❌ Expose gateway on internal port, map externally for testing

#### 4) Gateway Behavior and Endpoints
- ❌ Implement health endpoint (status, policy, rate settings)
- ❌ Implement stateless search endpoint with parameters:
  - Query text, author, title, category, format, page
  - Min/max size filters
- ❌ Apply query throttling and concurrency limits
- ❌ Handle upstream errors: 429/5xx retry with backoff, 403 session refresh
- ❌ Annotate results with wedge suggestion flags (read-only, no auto-spend)

#### 5) Session Management
- ❌ Lightweight endpoint to inject new mam_id at runtime
- ❌ If mamapi configured: poll periodically to update mam_id in memory
- ❌ Document operational process: session generation, IP vs ASN settings, 403 causes

#### 6) Book Fairy Integration
- ❌ Replace direct Prowlarr calls with gateway calls
- ❌ Add error handling paths:
  - Session invalid → trigger refresh flow
  - Rate limited → queue and retry
  - Indexer unavailable → back off and notify

#### 7) Remove Prowlarr Dependency
- ❌ Disable/remove Prowlarr container from stack
- ❌ Remove code paths calling Prowlarr
- ❌ Keep torrent client sessions separate (no cookie mixing)

#### 8) Testing and Validation
- ❌ Verify gateway health endpoint returns expected config
- ❌ Test targeted searches (audiobook/ebook categories)
- ❌ Confirm results and wedge annotations
- ❌ Simulate forced 403 to test bot refresh flow
- ❌ Simulate bursty searches to confirm throttling
- ❌ Verify torrent client continues working independently

#### 9) Operational Safeguards
- ❌ Add logging: upstream error types, search volumes, backoff events
- ❌ Add metrics counters: searches, errors, retries
- ❌ Document monthly check process: session rotation, ASN vs IP validation

#### 10) Acceptance Criteria
- ❌ Book Fairy searches MAM reliably via gateway (zero Prowlarr dependency)
- ❌ 403 errors automatically surface to refresh flow (not hard failures)
- ❌ Bulk searches don't trigger MAM rate limits under normal usage
- ❌ Separate sessions enforced for client and gateway (no cross-use)

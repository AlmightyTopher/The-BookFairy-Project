## Core Features

### Audiobooks: Fixed Labels with Live Link Refresh, 5 Item Pagination, Namlinks to Prowlarr Flow

#### New Canonical Audiobook Discovery System

A headless browsing and relay flow for discovering audiobooks through curated genre/time combinations:

- **Fixed Canonical Labels**: 12 hardcoded genres (Fiction, Mystery, Romance, etc.) and 6 time windows (week, month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, all time)
- **Runtime Link Refresh**: Always fetches fresh links from Mango-Mushroom site at request time
- **MAM Integration**: Navigates to MyAnonamouse results pages with automatic login
- **5-Item Pagination**: Matches title search UX exactly with "Page X of Y" indicator
- **Prowlarr Relay**: Sends selected items to Prowlarr (never downloads directly)
- **Rate Limited**: Per-guild and per-user rate limiting with graceful fallbacks

#### User Experience

1. Click "ðŸ“š Audiobooks" from main menu
2. Select from canonical genre list
3. Choose time window
4. Browse paginated results (5 per page)
5. Select item â†’ confirm â†’ send to Prowlarr

#### Technical Implementation

- `src/integrations/mango/mam-flow.ts` - Core flow manager with canonical labels
- `src/integrations/mango/prowlarr-relay.ts` - Secure handoff to Prowlarr
- Rate limiting and session state management
- Headless browser navigation with retry logic

#### Dry Run Mode

Test the scraping and pagination without calling Prowlarr:

```bash
npm run test:mam-flow
```

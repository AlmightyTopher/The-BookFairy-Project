# Control Flow Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The bot was immediately asking "Would you like to search for another book?" after initiating a download, violating the proper decision tree flow.

## Solution Implemented

### Session-Based State Management
- Added `UserSession` interface with proper state tracking
- Added `pendingDownload` flag to prevent premature re-prompting
- Implemented per-user session management with Map storage

### Proper Download Flow Control
Before:
```
User selects book → Download starts → Immediately asks for another search
```

After:
```
User selects book → Download starts → Includes next action prompt in download message → Waits for user input
```

### Key Changes

1. **handleDownloadRequest Method**:
   - Sets `session.pendingDownload = true` before download
   - Includes helpful prompt in download success/failure message
   - Resets `session.pendingDownload = false` after completion
   - No longer triggers immediate re-prompting

2. **shouldAskForAnotherSearch Logic**:
   ```typescript
   return session.hasShownResults && session.searchCount > 0 && !session.pendingDownload;
   ```
   - Only asks for another search when NOT in pending download state

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Download success: "✅ Started downloading "Book Title"! It'll be ready soon.\n\nWould you like to add another book? Just ask me to search for it!"
   - Download failure: "❌ Failed to download "Book Title": error\n\nWould you like to try another book? Just ask me to search for it!"

### Pagination Integration
- Maintained all existing pagination functionality
- Added `formatPaginatedResults` helper method for consistent formatting
- Preserved "next" command handling for browsing multiple pages

### State-Aware Decision Tree
The bot now follows proper UX flow:
1. User searches for book
2. Bot shows results with pagination
3. User selects number or says "next"
4. If number selected: Download initiated with helpful next-step prompt
5. User naturally decides what to do next (search again, exit, etc.)

## Benefits
- ✅ No more premature "search for another book" prompts
- ✅ Natural conversation flow that respects user decision-making
- ✅ Clear guidance on next steps without being pushy
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality (pagination, LLM-free operation, inclusive search)
- ✅ Proper state management for multi-user environments

## Usage Example
```
User: "search for dune"
Bot: Shows results 1-5 of 26 with pagination
User: "2"
Bot: "✅ Started downloading "Dune Messiah"! It'll be ready soon.

Would you like to add another book? Just ask me to search for it!"
User: [Can now naturally choose to search again, exit, or do something else]
```

The bot no longer violates user autonomy by immediately asking for another search after downloads.
